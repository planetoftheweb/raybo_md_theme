##raybo_md_theme
==============
Theme for Sublime Text with an emphasis on Markdown

## Color Schemes
Works well in Sublime Text (3), I haven't really tested it anywhere else. I made this using the awesome [Theme Editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) looking at a few different themes. It is designed to make markdown code easier to write with clear visuals for headlines, links, etc.

### Installation
I haven't figured out how to add this to the Sublime Package Manager, so for now:

1. Go Open Sublime Text 3
2. Go to the preferences menu and choose Preferences:Browse Packages
3. Find or create a User folder
4. Drop the .tmTheme file in there.
5. Go to Sublime Text:Preferences:Color Scheme:User:Raybo
